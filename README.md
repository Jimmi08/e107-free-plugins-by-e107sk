## Metatag plugin for e107

Full credit for this plugin belongs to lonalore.  

This plugin is a particular version planned for replacing some output of JM Canonical plugin. More oriented on not advanced users.

In progress. Highly experimental. At first, I need to test if those changes are correct. Then clean JM Canonical plugin. There is a high possibility that those changes will be applied back to JMC standard way of overriding original Metatag config. But direct replacements now can help to point where the problem is.
