# Contact Us plugin

This plugin is courtesy of the original author - Spinning Planet. They permitted me to update their old premium ContactUs plugin for the new version. 


## Version 1.2.2
- UPDATED google map adress and zoom moved from fb to prefs
- UPDATED recaptcha - use it only if it is active, installation is not enough

## Version 1.2.1

- FIXED required fields
- FIXED recaptcha
- UPDATED date field
- UPDATED textarea field

## Version 1.2.0 
  At this state, you can with this plugin:
- replace  core contact.php page 
- use simple contact form builder 
- save form data to the database
- set more recipients regardless of core email settings
- use Thank you page
- sent copy of the email to sender email
- use google map with API, google API and gmap3 script

Warnings:
a lot of old code 
tested only with e107sk.com environment (PHP 7.2)

Plans for the future:
fully replace ContentPage plugin

Use it only on your own risk. 
 

##### Versioning Guidlines

All versioning should attempt to follow the [Semantic Versioning guidlines](http://semver.org/).

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g v0.0.0), increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
