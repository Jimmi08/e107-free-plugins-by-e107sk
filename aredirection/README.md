# [e107 JM Redirection plugin](https://www.e107sk.com)

## Warning

No warning. The plugin is for personal use. Use it only if you know what are you doing. This functionality was initially the part of JM Canonical plugin. From version 1.5 it was moved to separate plugin. 

## Description

Folder name of this plugin is aredirection. The reason is that e107 plugins are loaded in alphabetical order. This plugin should be loaded before JM Canonical plugin to manage its purpose - to save some DB queries. 

It's more like an archive for canonical URLs with redirection, so most functionalities were put in JM Canonical plugin 1.5.  

Simple: if you get 404 warning in your webmaster tool, add redirection to existing page or homepage.

Move old data from Manual Canonical URLs:

The option Move is only with records with redirection and they are deleted after moving. You can move redirection in one click too. You can use old way how to create redirection and then just move it.

Supported from JM Canononical 1.5 only!
